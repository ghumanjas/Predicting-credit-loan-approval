# Predicting-credit-loan-approval

I am working on predicting loan credit approval for customers using a database.

The various steps followed for the project is as follows:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis in R
    - Basic Graphs
    - Treating Missing values - Both with Traditional measures(Mean, median) and with MICE package(Prediction method used also     included in the code)
    - Working with Continuous and Categorical Variables

2. Data Manipulation in R
   Using Dplyr
   Feature Engineering (Creation of new features, Transformation of features, Interaction between features)
   Label Encoding / One Hot Encoding (To convert categorical data to continous data type for ease of analysis)

3. Predictive Modeling using:
   Logistic Regression (Used K-cross validation technique for fit and confusion matrix for accuracy calculations)
   Random Forest
   XGBoost
